.							***THE HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM*** **(E-HEALTHCARE)**

**The e-Healthcare management system** is a web-based project that seeks to provide effective management oF medical data of patients in hospitals and 
clinics. Data Mining Techniques lies at the core of this project, which consists of 2 modules: an administration module and a client module.
 While the administration module is concerned with Medicare Management that includes healthcare departments, doctors, nurses, ward, and clerks,
 the client module is for patients.


.						 		**How The System Works**
								
This system (Project) is developed only for the Hospital Admins(staffs) which means only registered Staff can make use of thi Hospital system 
and the list of **Admin roles** in this system includes **THE SUPER-ADMIN, THE DOCTORS AND THE RECEPTIONIST** 
After the registration, then The SuperAdmin will Assign roles to the list of new registered Users based on their role in the Hospital or else New Users will only have access to an empty dashbord where they can only read the rules and regulations of the company.... **(SUPER-ADMIN LOGIN DETAILS;)** 


• **RECEPTIONIST:** The role of a Receptionist is to Register new patients in the hospital by inputing their Full required details 
and make sure it is saved in other to ensure that the Patient's record is stored. **( Safe keeping of Patient's Profile)....** and if the receptionist searches for the Patients name using the search box, and it appeared that the patient is already registered, then the receptionist won't need to register the patient again, he/she will just be directed to the doctor for diagnoses.....

• **DOCTORS:** The Doctor on the other side and from his own Dashbord, he should be able to Access Patients Medical Records and
if its a New patient that Does not have a medical record with the Hospital before, he should be able to creat one for him/her 
But if it the patient already have a Medical Record, then the Doctor would have seen it and he should be able to update the medical record 
based on the whatever the patient is diagnosed of... **(Doctors to be able to Update Patient medical records)**

Through these features, the e-Healthcare management system will help overcome the drawbacks and challenges of the existing healthcare management system.
 It will allow for the smooth management of hospital staff and quicken the process of delivery of healthcare services.
